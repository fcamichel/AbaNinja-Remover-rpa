# AbaNinja-Remover-rpa
Visual Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to remove addresses in AbaNinja

## Idea
After several address imports (csv) I had the problem that I had to archive and delete all wrong imported addresses. In February 2023, bulk deletion of archived addresses was not possible in AbaNinja. Since I now would have had to delete over 1800 entries manually, I wrote this code without further ado.

## Requirements

* RPA-Python
* AbaNinja in German (otherwise change the two png images: menu and remove)

## Demo
